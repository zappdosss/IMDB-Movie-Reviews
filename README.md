# Predicting the sentiment of IMDB Movie Reviews

The IMDB movie reviews are messy with a lot of punctuation, hastags and English slang. This project aims to predict the sentiment of the movie review as either Positive or Negative using the review text. The files in this repository implement the various stages of building a Machine Learning algorithm that can satisfy the objective. Here is a list of the files - 

Feature Engineering.ipynb - Vectorize the text using Count/Binary and TFIDF vectorizer
XGBoost - Implemented an XGBoost algorithm on the movie review text to predict the sentiment
NN - Implemented a Neural Network algorithm on the movie review text to predict the sentiment
